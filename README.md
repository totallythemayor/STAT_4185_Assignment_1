My name is Mayur Somalinga.

b. Major(s) and/or minor(s)
Major: Psychological Sciences
Minor: Cognitive Science, Analytics

c. Fun fact about yourself.
I am slightly color blind.

d. Do you have any previous Data Science experience, if so explain!
I gained previous Data Science experience through my Coding for Cognitive Science class, where we used Python and where I was introduced to Pandas and Seaborn. In fact, for my final project, I analyzed the sentiment of Inaugural and State of the Union addresses, using NLTK (especially the VADER sentiment analyzer), along with Pandas and Seaborn, to visualize the data, both comparatively and over time.

e. What do you think the Tom Golway quote means?
I think the quote means that a problem that is faced by the field of data science is that many data scientists may conjure up bold declarations, regarding the data, without having a solid understanding of the data and the many factors that may underlie it.
